# SkillBridge 

SkillBridge is a full-stack platform designed to connect students, advisors, and employers through a centralized system for job postings, applications, resume feedback, and issue reporting.

This project uses:
- **Python Flask** for the REST API
- **MySQL** for the database
- **Streamlit** for the frontend UI
- **Docker Compose** to orchestrate services
